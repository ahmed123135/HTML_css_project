        Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones
        Google announced the first generation Pixel smartphones, the Pixel and the Pixel XL, on October 4, 2016 during the #MadeByGoogle event.[1] Google emphasized the camera on the two phones, which ranked as the best smartphone camera on DxOMarkMobile with 90 points until HTC released the U11, which also scored 90 points.[2] This is largely due to software optimizations such as HDR+. The Pixel phones also include unlimited cloud storage for pictures on Google Photos[3] and, for devices purchased directly from Google, an unlockable bootloader.[4] Recently, a class action lawsuit[5] over faulty microphones in some devices enabled Pixel owners to claim up to $500 in compensation.
